## Simple shell in C
This project is an ALX SE project that is tasked to create a simple shell in C language.
In creating this program, we have to apply all that we have learnt from the beginning of learning C language.
So this repository contains an implementation of a simple UNIX shell in the C programming language.

### What is a shell?

A shell is a program that serves as an interface between the user and the operating system. It allows users to interact with the operating system by accepting commands and executing them. The shell provides a command-line environment where users can type commands, and it interprets and executes those commands.
